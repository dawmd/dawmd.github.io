            1. "Can not" vs. "cannot"
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Although they might seem to be similar or even the same, "can not" and "cannot" mean completely different
                things. Let's take a look at an example.</p>
            <div class="example">(1) <i>I <b>cannot</b> swim.</i> <br />(2) <i>I <b>can not</b> swim.</i></div>
            <p>The first sentence means you aren't able to swim. In other words, you don't possess skills necessary for
                swimming &mdash; you <i>can't</i> do that even if you want to. "Cannot" can be abbreviated to "can't".
            </p>
            <p>The second sentence is a little bit more tricky. It means you <i>are</i> able not to swim. Let's break
                the sentence into smaller pieces:</p>
            <div class="structure">
                I&emsp;+&emsp;<u>can</u>&emsp;+&emsp;<u>not swim.</u>
            </div>
            <p>You can treat the "can" and "not swim" as separate pieces. So, what you <i>can</i> do is "not swim";
                among the things you can do is "not swimming". "Can not" doesn't convey if you can actually swim or not.
                It only means you have a choice not to.</p>
            <br />
            <p>In speech, the difference between them is that in case of "can not", there's a very short pause between
                the words.</p>
