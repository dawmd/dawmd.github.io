        <!-- CAN NOT vs CANNOT -->
        <div class="section-subtitle" id="can-not">
            1. "Can not" vs. "cannot"
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Although they might seem to be similar or even the same, "can not" and "cannot" mean completely different
                things. Let's take a look at an example.</p>
            <div class="example">
                (&nbsp;1&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>I <b>cannot</b> swim.</i>
                <br />
                (&nbsp;2&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>I <b>can not</b> swim.</i>
            </div>
            <p>The first sentence means you aren't able to swim. In other words, you don't possess skills necessary for
                swimming &mdash; you <i>can't</i> do that even if you want to. "Cannot" can be abbreviated to "can't".
            </p>
            <p>The second sentence is a little bit more tricky. It means you <i>are</i> able not to swim. Let's break
                the sentence into smaller pieces:</p>
            <div class="structure">
                I&emsp;+&emsp;<u>can</u>&emsp;+&emsp;<u>not swim.</u>
            </div>
            <p>You can treat the "can" and "not swim" as separate pieces. So, what you <i>can</i> do is "not swim";
                among the things you can do is "not swimming". "Can not" doesn't convey if you can actually swim or not.
                It only means you have a choice not to. Keep also in mind that you <b>mustn't</b> shorten "can not" to
                "can't".</p>
            <br />
            <p>In speech, the difference between them is that in case of "can not", there's a very short pause between
                the words.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SINGULAR THEY -->
        <div class="section-subtitle" id="singular-they">
            2. Singular "they"
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>Sometimes you need to refer to someone of unspecified gender, for example when using "someone" or "no
                one". Some people use "he/she" or even "that person". That's rather inconvenient most of the time and
                the problem becomes even bigger when you need to use a possessive pronoun. "That person's" is rather
                long and repeating it will most likely make your speech/writing unnatural. There's a better alternative
                &mdash; the so-called <b>singular they</b>.</p>
            <br />
            <p>What is it and how does it work? It's just a normal "they" used the way you're used to. Let's look at
                some examples.</p>
            <div class="example">
                (&nbsp;1&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>When <b>someone</b>'s anxious, <b>they</b> should talk to <b>their</b> friends.</i>
                <br />
                (&nbsp;2&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>Every <b>parent</b> wants the best for <b>their</b> children.</i>
            </div>
            <p>In the first sentence, it's impossible to determine the gender of the person you're talking about because
                they're more like an abstract concept than a specific person. You could use "he/she", but it's rather
                wordy. Not to mention using "that person", which, at least in this case, sounds unnatural. The singular
                "they" helps deal with this issue.</p>
            <br />
            <p>The second sentence is pretty much the same. We don't know who exactly we're referring to with "parent",
                but by using "they", we can ignore it. This example is a bit more specific than the first one because
                you could ask: "Why not say: 'Parents want the best for their children'?". That's reasonable. This way,
                we don't have to deal with this mysterious use of "they" or use "he/she". However, it's not always this
                easy. Sometimes you don't have a choice and using the singular "they" is the most
                natural option you're left with.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Using this, you also don't risk insulting non-binary people, some of who don't like referring to them
                with "he" or "she". In conclusion, the singular "they" is also the safest option.</p>
            <br />
            <p>One more thing worth mentioning here is the reflexive form of this pronoun. As you probably know, the
                reflexive form of "they" is "themselves". Most people use it with the singular "they" as well, but you
                should be aware you might also come across this version of it: "<u>themself</u>". I personally prefer it
                because the suffix "-self" is used with all other singular pronouns: "my<u>self</u>", "your<u>self</u>",
                "one<u>self</u>", etc., so it makes sense to use it with the singular "they" as well; compare
                "your<u>self</u>" vs. "your<u>selves</u>".</p>
        </div>

        <!-- CONTRACTING "HAVE" -->
        <div class="section-subtitle" id="contracting-have">
            3. Contracting "have"
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p>You've probably noticed that "<b>have</b>" is sometimes contracted to "<b>'ve</b>" and "<b>has</b>" to "<b>'s</b>". However, it's not always correct. You can only contract "have" ("has") when it's used as an <a href="#auxiliary-verbs">auxiliary verb</a> in <a href="#perfect-aspect">the perfect aspect</a>. Otherwise, you <b>mustn't</b> contract it. Examples:</p>

            <div class="example">
                (&nbsp;1&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>I <b>have</b> a dog.</i>&nbsp;<span class="correct">+++</span>
                <br />
                (&nbsp;2&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>I<b>'ve</b> a dog.</i>&nbsp;<span class="incorrect">---</span>
                <br />
                (&nbsp;3&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>She <b>has</b> lived in London for 5 years.</i>&nbsp;<span class="correct">+++</span>
                <br />
                (&nbsp;4&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>She<b>'s</b> lived in London for 5 years.</i>&nbsp;<span class="correct">+++</span>
                <br />
                (&nbsp;5&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>He should <b>have</b> done it.</i>&nbsp;<span class="correct">+++</span>
                <br />
                (&nbsp;6&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>He should<b>'ve</b> done it.</i>&nbsp;<span class="correct">+++</span>
            </div>

            <p>Sentence (2) uses "have" in its literal sense (= to possess), so it's incorrect to contract it. Other sentences are correct because "have" functions as an auxiliary verb in the perfect aspect in them.</p>
            <br />
            <p>One <i>exception</i> to this rule is the phrase "have got" meaning that you possess something. In this case, you <i>can</i> contract the "have". Examples:</p>

            <div class="example">
                (&nbsp;1&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>She <b>has</b> got a dog.</i>&nbsp;<span class="correct">+++</span>
                <br />
                (&nbsp;2&nbsp;)&emsp;<i>She<b>'s</b> got a dog.</i>&nbsp;<span class="correct">+++</span>
            </div>
            <br />

                    Dialectal note
                </div>
                <p>Although in standard English contracting "have" is only limited to the perfect aspect, some dialects are more lax in this regard, for example Irish English. You can often see Irish English speakers write:
                </p>
                <div style="text-align: center">
                    I<b>'ve</b> a dog.&emsp;(meaning: "I <b>have</b> a dog")
                </div>
                <p>This, of course, is invalid usage in standard English, but it's valid in the dialect. <b>Don't</b> use it like this in exams and formal writing.</p>
